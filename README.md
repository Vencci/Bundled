# Bundled
This service will help users plan their weekly cooking by providing options for different “bundles”: highly efficient, data driven grocery shopping lists paired with prep videos and recipes. There are several dimensions to these bundles, namely differences in price, recipe difficulty level, style of food, and specialty categories aimed at specific diets and lifestyles. Users will dictate the number of meals they want to cook each week, the number of people they will be cooking for, and their dietary restrictions and preferences. The numbers of meals and people translate into changes in ingredient quantities for purchase, and the restrictions will change the options presented to the user. This model of meal planning is cheaper and more efficient than going out to eat, shopping without a plan, and meal kit delivery services like Blue Apron and Hello Fresh.
